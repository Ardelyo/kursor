# Kursor Project Report and Next Steps

## 1. Project Summary

Kursor is a Python-based application that provides an innovative way to control the computer mouse using hand and face gestures. It utilizes computer vision libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe to track hand and face movements, translating them into mouse actions such as pointer movement, clicks, and scrolling. The project aims to improve accessibility for users with physical limitations and offer a futuristic human-computer interaction experience.

The application features two main control modes:

*   **Hand Mode:** Tracks hand landmarks to control the cursor. Gestures like pinching fingers are used for clicking and other actions.
*   **Face Mode:** Tracks facial landmarks, using the nose as a pointer and detecting blinks or dwell time for clicks.

Kursor also includes a virtual keyboard, a graphical user interface (GUI) for settings configuration, and a detailed `readme.md` file with instructions and project information.

## 2. Current File Structure Analysis

The current file structure is flat, with all the Python scripts and configuration files in the root directory. This structure is simple for a small project but can become disorganized and difficult to maintain as the project grows.

```
kursor/
├───code - 2025-05-29T204823.554.docx
├───code - 2025-05-29T204823.554.html
├───code - 2025-05-29T204823.554.pdf
├───config_manager.py
├───gui_settings.py
├───main.py
├───mouse_handler.py
├───readme.md
├───requirements.txt
├───settings.json
├───tracker.py
├───virtual_keyboard.py
└───__pycache__/
```

The presence of `code - ...` files suggests that there may be some auto-generated or temporary files that should be ignored by version control.

## 3. Proposed File Structure

To improve organization and scalability, I propose the following file structure:

```
kursor/
├───assets/
│   └───... (images, icons, etc.)
├───docs/
│   └───report.md
├───kursor/
│   ├───__init__.py
│   ├───config/
│   │   ├───__init__.py
│   │   └───config_manager.py
│   ├───gui/
│   │   ├───__init__.py
│   │   └───gui_settings.py
│   ├───input/
│   │   ├───__init__.py
│   │   ├───mouse_handler.py
│   │   └───virtual_keyboard.py
│   ├───tracking/
│   │   ├───__init__.py
│   │   └───tracker.py
│   └───main.py
├───tests/
│   └───... (unit and integration tests)
├───.gitignore
├───LICENSE
├───README.md
├───requirements.txt
└───settings.json
```

This structure separates the application's source code from other project files like documentation, assets, and tests. The `kursor` directory becomes the main package, with sub-packages for different functionalities.

## 4. Roadmap and Next Steps

### 4.1. Code Organization

1.  **Create the new directory structure:** As proposed in section 3.
2.  **Move the files:** Relocate the existing Python files to their new locations.
3.  **Update imports:** Modify the import statements in the code to reflect the new structure.
4.  **Create `__init__.py` files:** To define the Python packages.
5.  **Create a `.gitignore` file:** To exclude temporary files, `__pycache__`, and other non-essential files from the repository.

### 4.2. Future Development

*   **Add Unit and Integration Tests:** Create a `tests` directory and implement a testing framework (e.g., `pytest`) to ensure code quality and stability.
*   **Improve the GUI:** Enhance the settings GUI with a more modern look and feel, and consider adding a main application window to provide real-time feedback and controls.
*   **Add More Gestures:** Expand the gesture vocabulary for both hand and face modes to allow for more complex actions.
*   **Improve Performance:** Optimize the computer vision algorithms to reduce CPU usage and improve responsiveness.
*   **Create an Installer:** Package the application into an executable file for easy installation on different operating systems.
*   **Add Voice Control:** Integrate a voice recognition engine to allow users to switch between modes and perform actions with voice commands.

By following this roadmap, the Kursor project can evolve into a more robust, scalable, and user-friendly application.
